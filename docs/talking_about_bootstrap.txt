First:  To import bootstrap, I used a Django app called bootstrap3.  You'll see it in the insmart/settings.py file's
INSTALLED_APPS section.  This means you'll probably need to pip or install it somehow.

When working on your pages, you'll probably want to start with home.html and follow the format of it.
Include the imports that you see in home.html, and check the user is authenticated.

Follow the example in home.html for a consistent look and feel throughout the project.  I tried to add some comments
along the way, so hopefully it's not too confusing.  Look at static/index.html for some content formatting ideas (it's
the dashboard layout mentioned below).  Try and match the same CSS imports and what-not when possible.

I'm no HTML and CSS expert, but I think using bootstrap will save us some time.  I recommend working with raw HTML or
plain Django tags when you're not sure how things should look, then go back over your components and set the right CSS
info afterwards.  Don't try to find the right bootstrap elements and django tags and html stuff all at once.  I found
myself setting a few properties, refreshing the page, undoing what I did, trying it a different way, and repeating quite
a bit.  It's nice that it'll automatically refresh content so you don't have to stop and start the server.

The "dashboard" layout at static/index.html is taken from here (scroll down to the examples):

Bootstrap 3 plugin for Django.  There may have been a Bootstrap 4 plugin, but I opted for the battle-tested version.

You will need this link.  This is where the tags we're going to use will come from.
