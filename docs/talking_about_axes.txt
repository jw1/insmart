We use the Django Axes project to do some lockout related functionality for us:
https://django-axes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html

In our project, we aim to have lockouts after successive invalid logins.

So, be sure to add the library to the project:
pip3 install django-axes  <<< From the command-line

Remember to run python manage.py migrate to sync the database.

If you mess up and lock yourself out, then issue "axes_reset" from the manage.py console.
